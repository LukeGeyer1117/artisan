### TODO

    * Take customers to an order summary page from their cart
        * Integrate payment redirect, but for now just allow the customer side to confirm the order
    * Show all of a merchant's active orders in their portal
        * Organize in rows that are compact, pretty, and contain vital information, with a modal screen to expand the details
    * Create order status changes the merchant can control
        * Status changes will create an email to the customer for updating them

    * Allow the merchant to upload pictures for gallery

    * Connect custom order portal to create custom requests
    * Show all custom requests in merchant portal
    * give merchant actions to approve or decline an order, possibly create a form for the merchant to message the customer with further questions.
        * If a merchant approves an order, create a customProduct Item to allow them to set a price, and allow the customer to check out that item
